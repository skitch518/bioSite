                <h2>🎯 Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The creation of this site was the first project I worked on post-graduation. I wanted a centralized hub to showcase my projects, link to my GitHub and LinkedIn, and demonstrate practical DevOps skills. What started as a simple static site evolved into a comprehensive learning experience in web hosting, infrastructure management, and secure API integration.</p>

                <h2>🔄 Hosting Evolution</h2>
                
                <h3>Phase 1: GitHub Pages</h3>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> GitHub Pages, Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript</p>
                <p>I started with GitHub Pages as it was familiar territory from college coursework. This provided a solid foundation for understanding static site deployment and version control integration.</p>
                <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> Git-based deployment workflows, Jekyll basics, DNS configuration for custom domains, limitations of static hosting.</p>
                
                <h3>Phase 2: Self-Hosting (Raspberry Pi + Nginx + Cloudflare Tunnel)</h3>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Raspberry Pi, Nginx web server, Cloudflare Tunnel, Linux server administration</p>
                <p>To gain hands-on experience with server management, I transitioned to local hosting. This phase taught me the most about infrastructure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Nginx configuration:</strong> Set up virtual hosts, configured SSL/TLS certificates, optimized static file serving</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloudflare Tunnel:</strong> Bypassed ISP port blocking (80/443) by creating a secure tunnel from my Raspberry Pi to Cloudflare's edge network, eliminating the need for port forwarding</li>
                    <li><strong>Linux administration:</strong> User permissions, systemd services, log monitoring, security hardening</li>
                    <li><strong>Network architecture:</strong> Understanding reverse proxies, DNS propagation, CDN benefits</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Challenges solved:</strong> ISP residential connection limitations, dynamic IP management, securing a publicly accessible home server.</p>
                <p><strong>Why I moved on:</strong> While successful, the Raspberry Pi lacked a UPS (uninterruptible power supply), leading to potential downtime during power fluctuations. Additionally, I wanted to repurpose the Pi for other projects and IoT experiments.</p>
                
                <h3>Phase 3: Cloudflare Pages (Current)</h3>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Cloudflare Pages, Cloudflare Workers, Git integration, Serverless functions</p>
                <p>Moving to Cloudflare Pages provided enterprise-grade hosting with minimal operational overhead:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automatic deployments:</strong> Git push triggers immediate builds and deployments</li>
                    <li><strong>Global CDN:</strong> Content served from edge locations worldwide for optimal performance</li>
                    <li><strong>99.99% uptime SLA:</strong> Eliminated availability concerns from home hosting</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero maintenance:</strong> No server updates, patches, or infrastructure management needed</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>⚙️ Technical Implementation</h2>
                
                <h3>API Integration: OpenWeather API</h3>
                <p>I integrated the OpenWeather API to display real-time weather data, providing practical experience with external API consumption and asynchronous JavaScript.</p>
                
                <h3>Security Challenge: Protecting API Keys</h3>
                <p>The primary challenge with client-side API calls is exposure of API keys in browser developer tools. I solved this using Cloudflare Workers:</p>
                
                <h4>Initial approach (Insecure):</h4>
                <pre><code>// Direct API call from client - EXPOSES API KEY
fetch(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=${API_KEY}`);</code></pre>
                
                <h4>Solution: Cloudflare Worker as Proxy</h4>
                <p>I created a serverless function that acts as a secure intermediary:</p>
                <pre><code>// Cloudflare Worker (runs on edge servers)
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url)
  const city = url.searchParams.get('city')
  
  // API key stored in Worker environment variables (secure)
  const apiKey = OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
  const apiUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}`
  
  const response = await fetch(apiUrl)
  const data = await response.json()
  
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
    headers: { 
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*' 
    }
  })
}</code></pre>

                <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript calls my Worker endpoint (no API key exposed)</li>
                    <li>Worker retrieves the API key from secure environment variables</li>
                    <li>Worker makes the API request server-side</li>
                    <li>Worker returns the weather data to the client</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Benefits of this approach:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>API key never exposed to client browsers</li>
                    <li>Request rate limiting can be implemented at the Worker level</li>
                    <li>Additional validation and sanitization of user input</li>
                    <li>Potential for response caching to reduce API calls</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Difference from College Approach (dotenv)</h3>
                <p>In college, I used dotenv for environment variables in Node.js applications running on a server. However, this doesn't work for static sites where JavaScript runs entirely in the browser. The Cloudflare Worker solution provides server-side execution in a serverless environment, bridging the gap between static hosting and secure API access.</p>
