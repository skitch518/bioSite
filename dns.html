                <h2>üöÄ Initial Raspberry Pi Setup</h2>
		  <p> I followed the instructions from this helpful video, along with the manual, to assemble the 
                      PironMan 5 case. However, I initially purchased the wrong SD card‚Äîa regular SD card instead of 
                      a microSD card. This led me to make a quick trip to the store during assembly to get the correct      
                      microSD card and a converter to connect it to my PC.</p>

                <h2> üçìPi-OS Installation & Configuration</h2>

                <h3><span class="step-counter">1 </span>Installed Pi-OS on Micro SD</h3>
                    <p>Downloaded the installer from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/" target="_blank">
                       Raspberry Pi Software</a>.
		       You can purchase a Raspberry Pi with a preformatted card, but I recommend formatting it yourself 
 		       to have more control, such as setting passwords and enabling SSH, among other configurations.</p>                

               <h3><span class="step-counter">2 </span>Downloaded Pi-Hole</h3>
   		   <p>I used Claude to walk me through the installation of Pi-Hole. I am running the server headless, but I 		    initially failed to enable SSH correctly. As a result, I had to connect a monitor to the Pi to properly 		    connect it to my main PC.</p>

	      <h3><span class="step-counter">3 </span>Connected Client PC to DNS</h3>
		  <p>I continued the setup process with Claude as my guide. I use Spectrum as my ISP, and my router blocks  
		     me from making adjustments, so I had to manually set up each client.</p>

	      <h3><span class="step-counter">4 </span>Set Up NVMe as Boot Drive</h3>
		  <p>After successfully connecting my PC as a client to the new DNS server, I realized I had forgotten to
		     set up the 1TB NVMe drive. Once again, Claude helped me partition the drive, install the necessary 
		     software, and configure it to boot from the drive instead of the microSD card. This setup provides 
		     increased storage and faster read/write speeds.</p>

	      <h3><span class="step-counter"></span>What I Would Do Differently</h3>
		  <p>I used AI to assist me with this project, but for future projects, I'd like to take more notes and 
		     learn more from the process. I also want to try using an Orange Pi. Although they are not as 
   		     well-supported, they offer much greater performance while still being affordable.</p>
